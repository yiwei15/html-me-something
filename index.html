        <h2 id= "method1">Begginer Method</h2>
        <article>All methods have different levels of difficulties, 
            for speedcubers or beginners, 
            even for solving the cube blindfolded. 
            People usually get stuck solving the cube after completing the first face, 
            after that they need some help. Below video shows 
            you the easiest way to solve the cube using the beginner's method.

        <h2 id= "method2">CFOP</h2>
        <article>The most popular Speedsolving method is 
            the CFOP (Cross, First 2 layers, Orientation of last layer, 
            Permutation of last layer) a.k.a Fridrich Method. 
            Unlike The beginner's method, 
            the Speedsolving method focuses mainly about 
            solving the Rubik's cube in the fastest and 
            most efficient way, rather than the easiest way.

        <h2 id= "method3">ZZ</h2>
            <article>The ZZ Method or Zbigniew Zborowski Method is a 
                fast method for solving the Rubik's Cube created in 2006. 
                It consists of three different steps: EOLine 
                (Edge Orientation Line), F2L (First Two Layers), 
                and LL (Last Layer).

        <h2 id= "method4">Petrus</h2>
             <article>The Petrus method is created in 1981 by Lars Petrus. 
                 There are seven steps - 2x2x2 block, expand to 2x2x3, twist bad edges, 
                 finish first two layers, position last layer corners, 
                 twist last layer corners, and position last layer edges.

        <h2 id= "method5">Roux</h2>
             <article>Roux is a Rubik's cube speedsolving method invented by Gilles Roux. 
            Unlike the CFOP and Petrus methods, the inventor of this method has 
            used it to achieve an official sub-15 average. 
            It is the favorite method of many top OH solvers. 
            Similarities can be drawn to the Petrus method's block building and 
            the Waterman method's layer-on-the-left and edges-last aspects.
